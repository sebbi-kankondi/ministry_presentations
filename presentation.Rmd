# NatMIRC

.itl-orange[**4 Main sections** - names defined by research area/oceanic zone research is based on.]

???
these names associate these sections with the ocean zone/region their research is based on, albeit very loosely. Now before I elaborate I'd like to quickly go over what you see in this graphic infront of you.

The main focus of this graphic is the oceanic zones (epi, meso, bathy, abyssal)
We can distinguish between these zones based primarily on the amount of meaningful sunlight they receive.
epipelagic zone - receives enough sunlight for photosynthesis and is highly productive
mesopelagic - experiences a dramatic decrease in sunlight and limited photosynthetic activity
bathypelagic and abyssalpelagic zones - receive no sunlight at all, experience no sunlight derived primary activity, deepest zone, extreme pressure, and there is a severe lack of food in both zones

Littoral/intertidal sediment zone - coastal zone where tide fluctuates between low and high, substratum exposed to air during low tide and submerged during high tide.

Sublittoral/subtidal sediment zone - Immediately after littoral zone toward sea, continually submerged (5m - 200m beneath the sea surface)

Benthic - which refers to the bottom sediment of the ocean, irrespective of oceanic zone


Examples of animals in bathypelagic:
Lantern fish - small, luminescent; Vampire squid - invert webbed arms and cloak bodies

Examples of animals in abyssalpelagic:
Deep-sea angler fish - modified dorsal fin with bioluminescent tip to lure prey;
Fangtooth fish - large teeth, disproportionately large head size

The other Cape fur seal subspecies is *Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus*. Visual differences: *A.p.p* larger, lighter fur, reddish brown back. *A.p.d* distinct V shaped mark on chest. Audio *A.p.p* higher pitched, nasal; *A.p.d* deeper, throaty. 
Some seals found > 200km off shore.

Mid water seine: large cone shaped net, wide open mouth and closed off rear, fit with floats to keep it at mid water. Net towed behind fishing vessels.

Normal seawater oxygen concentration = 5-8 mL/L
Set lines with several hooks, retrieved after some time. Purse seine less common.

The methods used to monitor and assess pelagic resources include 

Echosounder: emits sound waves that bounces off objects in underwater environment which is then retrieved and displays as an echogram using specialized software. The data is then analyzed using data analysis software e.g., R, Matlab

Aerial: We currently hire an aircraft from a company called Bush skies aviation. The camera has to be mounted to bottom of aircraft on a gyro-stabilized platform. This ensures the camera operator can take clear pictures that are in focus, remotely from inside the aircraft using a control panel.

This gives us an idea of the abundance, distribution and composition of our pelagic resources

Examples of sample methods used to assess our demersal resources include trawling and laying traps


Like mid water seine fishing, the nets are conical....

Swept area trawling
- image is a multi rig setup
- Floats attached to the top help keep it open (also use Otter boards)
- Provides an index of abundance, which can then be converted into an absolute measure of biomass.

Lobster surveys
- Post-larvae lobsters actively select these shelter providing microhabitats. - traps left on floor for some time
- Traps have elevated funnel shaped entrance, just large enough for large lobsters
- Once inside cage, lobsters find it difficult to find their way back out.

   
Crab surveys
- On shore activities conducted within appropriately equipped facilities.
- Crab lured into the cage with the bait.
- The trap door lets them into the cage but, does not let them back out.

EBUS - eastern side of major ocean basin e.g., atlantic and pacific

Upwelling: South easterly winds + ocean currents blow warm surface waters 
offshore. Allowing cold, nutrient rich water from the northward flowing benguela current to rise up in the water column. Where the increased nutrients 
can support increased primary production through phytoplankton in surface waters.
In turn supports larger fauna abundances along west coast.

CTD: Programmable sensors mounted within larger device called CTD rosette. Includes set of 
weights/floats and water sampling bottles. Also records DO2.

ADCP: Sensors used across various ocean depths using sound wave technology.
Eddies: Swirling circular currents, caused by interaction of ocean currents with seafloor topography/wind.
Fronts: Boundaries between water masses with different physical properties, caused by interaction of ocean currents with mixing of different water masses.
boundary currents: ocean currents that flow along edge of a continent or ocean basin e.g., agulhus current on east coast of SA.
Dopplers: class of sensors with that emit frequencies used to detect moving objects.


SST and CHL-A: Data used to generate these maps obtained from MUR (Multi-scale Ultra High Resolution) dataset. Generated from combination of various different datasets.
Spectroradiometers normally record the spectral distribution of light with applications in characterizing colour that is then used to generate values used to compile sst datasets.

Longline: 
Oyster bred through hatchery production systems that consist of tanks on-shore, once certain age/size removed from hatchery and fixed to lines. Age determined through growth ring analysis of their shells under a microscope, called the shell growth increment method (approximation).
Common names - mediterranean mussel and European flat oyster

tanks:
Abalone normally found in subtidal waters (2-15m) on rocky surfaces, in crevices or in cliff overhangs. Ontogenetic vertical distribution across shore (Juveniles on higher shore zones).

Penalties for any individual, vessel or company found to be in contravention of the laws and regulations governing Namibia's EEZ, depend on the nature/severity of the offence committed. These include fines, license suspension or revocation and in extreme cases the seizure of vessels or imprisonment.
These penalties are designed to be commensurate with the offence committed.

Several factors contributing to declining fish stocks
Primary suspect is overfishing: fishing efforts exceed ability of fish stock to replenish themselves.
There is also illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing (IUU): illegal fishing practices include fishing without permits, using prohibited fishing gear and fishing in restricted areas.
Destruction of habitats/habitat loss via climate change: the loss of important breeding sites i.e., reefs, kelp forests, etc. Or a change in ocean chemistry through the process of ocean acidification (increase in its pH) and an increase in temperature which can cause major fish die offs.
inadequate or ineffective management practices: These include weak regulations, a lack of enforcement of those regulations or poor monitoring systems, all of which can contribut to unsustainable fishing practices.

Information from landings data help MFMR determine overarching regulatory parameters i.e., MSY and TAC

MSY: Population model accounts for factors such as the birth and death rates,  amount of fishing pressure on the population, and the level of natural mortality due to predation or disease.
Once generated, the population model can be used to calculate MSY, this is done by simulating different levels of fishing pressure on the population and then identifying the level at which the population is able to maintain a stable level of abundance.


TAC: Determined through a process of stock assessment and consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fisheries resources. Stock assessment involves collecting and analyzing data on fish abundance, distribution, growth, reproductive and mortality rates. Which is used to determine the size and health of population and its ability to sustainably support harvest. After stock assessment continue with consultation process with stakeholders (fishing communities, fishermen, scientists and government officials). Stakeholders give input on range of factors such as the social and economic impacts of the fishery, sustainability of the current fishing practices and the effectiveness of the management measures.
TAC set to maintain a balance between the needs of the fishing industry and the long term health of the fish population. Once set it is divided among individual fishermen or fishing companies as individual fishing quotas (IFQ) or other types of catch limits.

Can also be  directly involved in conservation efforts, by acting as a sanctuary for marine life who's well being is under immediate danger. e.g., Injured Green sea turtle that was brought to the aquarium. But conservation efforts mainly facilitated through educating the general public on the importance of the marine ecosystem to our own continued survival.
