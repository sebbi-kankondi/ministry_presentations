Swept area trawling
- image is a multi rig setup
- Provides an index of abundance, which can then be converted into an absolute measure of biomass.

Lobster surveys
- Post-larvae lobsters actively select shelter providing these sheltered microhabitats. 
- Quadrats help standardize the sampling effort.
- The bags are used to collect the lobsters for sizing activities on shore
   - Also prevents lobsters from specific sample quadrat escaping.
   
Crab surveys
- On shore activities conducted within appropriately equipped facilities.
- Crab lured into the cage with the bait.
- The trap door lets them into the cage but, does not let them back out.

What is Mariculture
- Specialized branch of aquaculture, involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products.

Oysters
- Change from male to female or vice versa.
- Protandrous 
   - From male to female
- Protogynous
   - From female to male.
- Trait shown in many other aquatic invertebrates

Abalone
- Both its flesh and its shells are sold globally.

Giant kelp
- Also called bladder kelp.
- Attaches to rocks through a structure called a holdfast.
- Protists are organisms that contain a cell nucleus that is not an animal, plant or fungus
- Obtains its nutrients directly from the water and not through roots.
